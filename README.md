# Rainbow 1-factorizations of complete graphs

Sage code for:
- making cyclic extended Skolem sequences
- 1-rotational 1-factorizations of complete graphs
- exploratory analysis of rainbow 1-factorizations

Sage is a mathematical program built on Python. Here we use
its libraries for manipulating graphs, cyclic groups and finate fields.
